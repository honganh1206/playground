# Single Sign-On

- Definition: Allow different applications to **re-use** the same authentication data => Allow you to  log on a website that youâ€™ve never used before by using your Google or Facebook credentials
- The compatibility of apps with different SSO providers was made possible by** the standardization of authentication protocols** e.g. combination of OpenID Connect (Authentication) and OAuth (Authorization)

# Overview of OpenID Connect and OAuth

## OpenID Connect

- Users - SSO application - Original application

- General flow
	1. User opens an application and login
	2. The app gets *redirected to the authentication page* of SSO provider application
	3. If user enters the right credentials => A time-sensitive code is generated by the SSO application
	4. SSO provider **redirects the user back to the original application** and **share the code with the application**
	5. Code sent back to SSO provider, if the codes matches => Return authentication token to original application
	6. Token stored in a coolie so the original application knows the user is authenticated

```ad-info
The original application that the user wants to access **has absolutely no idea what the user credentials are**.

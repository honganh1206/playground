```sql
CREATE INDEX IX_ExPlanOperator_P2_EmpFirst_Name ON ExPlanOperator_P2 (EmpFirst_Name)

SELECT * FROM ExPlanOperator_P2 WHERE EmpFirst_Name = 'BB' -- This is executed without a clustered index
```

- Without a clustered index, the query above only returns a list with employeeâ€™s first name + pointers to where the rest of the data we want to retrieve => Heap table that still requires a full table scan

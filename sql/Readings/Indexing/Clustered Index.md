- **Unique index per table** that uses the primary key to organize data within the table
- The primary key is stored in increasing order = the order the table holds in memory
- Some traits:
	- Clustered indexes do not have to be explicitly declared.
	- Created when the table is created.
	- Use the primary key sorted in ascending order.

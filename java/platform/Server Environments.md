# Server Environments

### Traditional Application Servers

- WebSphere, WebLogic, JBoss/WildFly
- Full Java EE/Jakarta EE implementation
- Admin console, clustering, session replication

### Servlet Containers

- Tomcat, Jetty
- Lighter weight than full application servers
- Focus on web components (servlets, JSP)

### Standalone Microservices

- No external container needed
- Application packages server components
- Simplified deployment and scaling

## Build Tools and Dependency Management

### [[Maven]]

- **Core Concept**: Convention over configuration
- **Key Components**:
  - POM (Project Object Model) - XML-based project configuration
  - Lifecycle phases (validate, compile, test, package, verify, install, deploy)
  - Dependency management through centralized repositories
- **Strengths**:
  - Standardized project structure
  - Rich plugin ecosystem
  - Built-in dependency management
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Verbose XML configuration
  - Less flexible build scripts compared to Gradle

### [[Gradle]]

- **Core Concept**: Groovy/Kotlin DSL for build automation
- **Key Components**:
  - Build scripts (build.gradle)
  - Task-based model with dependency graph
  - Plugin system for extending functionality
- **Strengths**:
  - Concise, programmatic build scripts
  - Incremental builds for better performance
  - Advanced caching mechanisms
  - Support for multi-project builds
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Steeper learning curve than Maven
  - More complex configuration for large projects

### Ant (Legacy)

- **Core Concept**: XML-based procedural build tool
- **Key Components**:
  - build.xml describing build tasks
  - No standard project layout or lifecycle
- **Status**: Largely replaced by Maven/Gradle but still maintained in legacy systems

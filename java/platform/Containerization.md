# Containerization

### Docker

- **Approach**: Package Java applications with JRE and dependencies in containers
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent environments across development, testing, and production
  - Isolation of application dependencies
  - Simplified deployment process
- **Best Practices**:
  - Multi-stage builds to reduce image size
  - JVM tuning for containerized environments
  - Resource constraint awareness

### JIB

- Google's tool for building optimized Docker images for Java applications
- Tightly integrated with Maven and Gradle
- Creates layered Docker images _without requiring Docker daemon_

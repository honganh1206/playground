## Summary of Current Trends

1. **Shift toward containerization** and cloud-native deployment
2. **Microservices architecture** leading to smaller, more focused deployment units
3. **Serverless Java** becoming more viable with improved tooling and runtime optimization
4. **Native compilation** gaining traction for resource-constrained environments
5. **Infrastructure as Code** becoming standard practice for Java application deployment
6. **DevOps integration** with automated testing and deployment pipelines

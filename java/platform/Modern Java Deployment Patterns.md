# Modern Java Deployment Patterns

### Spring Boot Deployment Options

- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow)
- Standalone executable JARs
- Traditional WAR deployment
- Spring Boot Actuator for operational tooling

### Quarkus

- Compile-time boot optimization
- Native image compilation via GraalVM
- Optimized for serverless and container environments

### Micronaut

- Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation
- Reduced memory footprint
- Fast startup time

### Native Image with GraalVM

- Compile Java applications to native executables
- Benefits: faster startup, lower memory footprint
- Challenges: reflection limitations, build complexity
